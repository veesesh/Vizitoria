# Vizitoria

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
flask run
```

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) with your browser to see the result.

## Inspiration 💡
Observing the challenges faced by individuals waiting outside and witnessing the inefficiencies caused by the absence of a proper visitor management system, I found myself deeply inspired to develop a solution.

## What it does 💪
Vizitoria, the system I have created, streamlines the visitor management process by capturing the necessary details of visitors to an organization. It leverages the power of technology to send automated WhatsApp messages to the desired contacts, facilitating the scheduling of appointments and enhancing overall efficiency.

## How we built it ❓🧠
I made it with ♥ 
I utilized Python, Flask, MongoDB, Twilio, and Visual Studio Code to bring this system to life.

## Challenges we ran into 🧗
Throughout the project, we encountered several challenges. Due to limitations in time and available resources, certain aspects such as creating an aesthetically pleasing user interface and implementing additional features, proved difficult to accomplish.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🎗️🏆
Despite the challenges faced, I take pride in my perseverance and determination to not give up. The journey of creating Vizitoria has been a significant achievement in itself.

## What we learned: 👨‍🎓
During the development of Vizitoria, I had the opportunity to gain valuable knowledge in utilizing Flask, a web framework, and MongoDB, a NoSQL database. This project enabled me to expand my skills and deepen my understanding of these technologies.

## What's next for Vizitoria 🔮
Moving forward, I have an ambitious roadmap for Vizitoria. The next steps involve enhancing the user interface, implementing a robust response system, integrating ID card functionality, and incorporating barcode scanning capabilities. These additions will further elevate the efficiency and effectiveness of the visitor management system, providing an even better user experience.
